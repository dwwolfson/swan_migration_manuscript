This repo contains R code used to conduct all the analyses in the manuscript 'Migration ecology of a re-established trumpeter swan population'.

The full dataset is very large, even in a zipped version, and is not included, so scripts 1-4 and 13 will not run, but they are retained in case the code is helpful.

Output files have been included so that scripts 5-12 and 14-16 can be run.
