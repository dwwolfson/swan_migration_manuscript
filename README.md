This repository contains R code used to conduct all the analyses in the manuscript 'High variability of migration strategies in a reestablished Trumpeter Swan population'.

The full dataset is very large (745MB), even in a zipped version (235MB), and is not included, so scripts 1-4 and 13 will not run, but they are retained in case the code is helpful.

Output files have been included so that scripts 5-14 and 16-17 can be run. Making the map in script 7 requires first downloading a raster from www.naturalearthdata.com.
